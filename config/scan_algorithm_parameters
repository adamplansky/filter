# equation for scan algorithm is (p + 95) mod 100 == 0
# where p is number of scans from one ip in one hour
# first number is x and second number is y in first valid row in this equation (p + x) mod y
# parser is finding first row where is two numbers delimited by space 'x y'
# (p + 95) mod 100 means: there will be capture request for scan if
# some detector detects category: reckon.scanning with same ip for 5, 105, 205, 305 times
